en_US copy.json is the edited en_US.json file which adds oʊɹ to any pronunciation with the ɔɹ sound.
For example, horse originally only had the pronunciation "/ˈhɔɹs/", but was edited to also have the 
pronunciation "/ˈhoʊɹs/". This also includes IPA notation with stress marks ˈ or ˌ in between the characters.
